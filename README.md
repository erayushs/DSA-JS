# What is DSA?

DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms.

- Data Structures are ways to organize and store data (like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) so they can be used efficiently.

- Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems (like sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming).

# Why DSA is important?

DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is important because it helps you write efficient code, solve problems logically, and handle real-world data effectively. Itâ€™s also a key part of technical interviews for most software development jobs.
